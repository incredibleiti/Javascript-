Data Types
JavaScript's Data Types
The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:

A primitive value or data type is data that is not an object and has no methods. All primitives are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed. There are six primitive types:
Number
String
Boolean
Symbol
Null
Undefined
The seventh data type is Object.


Number Data Type
According to the ECMAScript standard, all numbers are double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754-2008, meaning there is no specific type for integers.

Maximum Value for a Number
The MAX_VALUE property has a value of approximately . Values larger than Number.MAX_VALUE are represented as Infinity.

Minimum Value for a Number
The MIN_VALUE property is the smallest positive value of the Number type closest to , not the most negative number, that JavaScript can represent. MIN_VALUE has a value of approximately . Values smaller than Number.MIN_VALUE ("underflow values") are converted to .

Symbolic Numbers
There are three symbolic number values:

Infinity: This is any number divided by , or an attempt to multiply Number.MAX_VALUE by an integer .
-Infinity: This is any number divided by , or an attempt to multiply Number.MAX_VALUE by an integer .
NaN: This stands for "Not-a-Number" and denotes an unrepresentable value (i.e., ).
The isSafeInteger Method
A safe integer is an integer that:

Can be exactly represented as an IEEE-754 double precision number, and
Whose IEEE-754 representation cannot be the result of rounding any other integer to fit the IEEE-754 representation.
The Number.isSafeInteger() method determines whether the provided value is a number that is a safe integer.
